## Background


* Statistical heterogeneity can be described as consistent study effect-size differences among participating studies in a meta-analysis, across the array of genetic variants examined.

* The getmstatistic function `?getmstatistic` computes M statistics to quantitatively describe systematic heterogeneity in meta-analysis.

* M statistics are useful for identifying outlier studies which show null effects or consistently show stronger/weaker effects than average.

## Properties of the M-statistic

* M's power to detect systematic heterogeneity patterns increases the number and strength of association of variants examined in the meta-analysis.

* Furthermore, M's power is relatively indepenent of the number of studies in a meta-analysis.

* The M statistic is can be applied to meta-analyses with few studies (e.g. 10 studies).

## A few tips for a succesful M analysis

Prior to conducting an M analysis: 

* ensure that the effect alleles for participating studies in the meta-analysis are aligned. This can be achieved by "flipping" the beta-values (i.e. multiply by -1) of misaligned effect alleles.

* apply a study-level genomic corrrection to the standard errors to minimize false positives.

    For example: gcse <- se * sqrt(lambda)`





## Data: heartgenes214

#### We shall use the heartgenes214 dataset for our M analysis.

```

heartgenes214 is a multi-ethnic GWAS meta-analysis dataset for coronary
artery disease.

It comprises summary data (effect-sizes and their corresponding standard errors) for 
48 studies (68,801 cases and 123,504 controls), at 214 lead variants independently 
associated with coronary artery disease (P < 0.00005, FDR < 5%). Of the 214 lead variants, 
44 are genome-wide significant (p < 5e-08). The meta-analysis dataset is based on individuals 
of: African American, Hispanic American, East Asian, South Asian, Middle Eastern and European 
ancestry. 

```

#### Note:
* The beta-values in heartgenes214 have already been flipped to align effect alleles.

* Also, the standard errors have been genomically controlled at the study-level.

## The basics: Conducting an *M* analysis

The getmstatistic function requires the following variables for an M analysis:

* A numeric vector of beta-values i.e. study effect-sizes.
* A numeric vector of standard errors.
* A character vector of variant/SNP names.
* A character vector of study names.

## Understanding the plots generated by getmstatistic

![getmstatistic_plots](fig/getmstatistic_vignette_fig_even_smaller.png) 

M scatterplot: M statistics for each study in the meta-analysis (Y- axis) are plotted against the average variant effect size (expressed as odds ratios) (X-axis) in each study. 
    The dashed lines indicate the Bonferroni corrected 5% significance threshold (M= Â±0.483) to allow for multiple testing of 48 studies. 
    Studies showing weaker (M < 0) than average genetic effects can be distinguished from those showing stronger (M > 0) than average effects.


## A step further: Exploring available options

# Subset the GWAS significant variants (p < 5e-08) in heartgenes214
heartgenes44 <- subset(heartgenes214, heartgenes214$fdr214_gwas46 == 2)

# Exploring getmstatistic options:
#     Estimate heterogeneity using "REML", default is "DL"
#     Modify x-axis of M scatterplot
#     Run M analysis verbosely
getmstatistic_results <- getmstatistic(heartgenes44$beta_flipped,
